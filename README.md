Hello everyone!

This is the recruitment task I have done to confirm my skills while working with Web API (.NET Core technology).
I have solved the following problems here

- I implemented simple unit tests
- I implemented basic crud operations
- Includes implemented simple authentication
- The application is made in a three-layer architecture (Data access layer, Business Logic Layer, API)





## Setup
#### Requirements
- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), *>= 3.1*

#### Installation of packages 
```bash
dotnet restore
```
#### Do the tests
```bash
dotnet test
```

#### Run development server
By default, the server starts on port 5001 (http: 5000)

```bash
dotnet run
```

It's only a recruitment task, it performs only simple crud tasks!
